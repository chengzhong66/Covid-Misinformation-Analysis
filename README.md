This dataset contains text data on covid-19 information tweets. The labels for the tweets are two categories, real and false. Building a predictive model using that is practically useful for identifying the truthfulness of information. It could improve the efficiency for the public to adopt correct knowledge for covid and prevent the spread of rumors.

The text data reflect different patterns for true and false tweets. For instance, veracious tweets generally show a neutral tone, use informative language, and avoid hateful speech. On the other hand, false news tweets show their inflammatory nature, deny scientific approaches to fight over the pandemic, and incite ignorance and hatred.

By applying deep learning algorithms to this dataset, these patterns of real and false tweets could be analyzed and identified in a relatively automated way. The models generated could be used for future inputs, and the decision makers could predict future trends and regulations and optimize resources.
